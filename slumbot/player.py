"""
This project's solver, playing a hand dealt by Slumbot.

The bridge turns Slumbot's betting string into the solver's own history key and
chip accounting; this puts the two together and produces an action. It reuses
`evaluation.benchmark.cfr_agent` rather than reimplementing the lookup, through a
shim that presents the four things that agent actually reads. A second copy of
the lookup is exactly how the agent measured here would drift from the agent
measured on the panel, and then the two numbers would not be about the same
thing.

What this is honestly measuring
-------------------------------
A 100bb, one-raise-per-street strategy playing a 200bb unlimited-raise opponent.
That is not the solver's strength at Slumbot's game and should never be quoted as
though it were. It is the first number in this project that somebody else's agent
produced, which is the whole of what milestone M1 claims.

Two counters come back with every session for that reason: `misses`, the fraction
of decisions where the strategy had no entry and the agent chose among legal
actions at random, and `off_abstraction`, bets too large for the abstraction to
describe. A high miss rate means the result is largely a measurement of a random
agent wearing the solver's name -- the failure this project has already published
once, at a 74.3% miss rate.
