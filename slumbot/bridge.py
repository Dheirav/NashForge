"""
Slumbot's hand, expressed as something this project's solver can answer.

The transport is `slumbot/api.py`; this is the layer between it and an agent.
`docs/EXTERNAL_BENCHMARK.md` is explicit that this is most of the engineering and
that a bug in it is indistinguishable from a weak strategy, so it is a module
with its own tests and no network in it.

What it has to bridge
---------------------
Slumbot bets any legal amount. This project plays six abstract actions, and its
solver was fitted over them. So an incoming bet has to be read *as* one of the
six, and an outgoing abstract action has to become a chip amount.

The inbound mapping is not rounding. `abstraction/translation.py` already
implements the pseudo-harmonic mapping of Ganzfried & Sandholm (2013), which
sends a bet probabilistically to its two neighbouring sizes: a deterministic
nearest-size rule has a boundary, and a boundary is a thing an opponent sits just
inside of. That module is used rather than reimplemented.

The two mismatches this cannot fix, and does not pretend to
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Depth.** Slumbot plays 200 big blinds; the solver was fitted for 100. Bets are
translated as fractions of the pot, which insulates the middle sizes, but not
all-in: at 200bb it is twice as far away as anything the strategy was solved for.

**Raises per street.** The solver knows one. Slumbot re-raises. A re-raise puts
the node off-tree, the lookup misses, and `cfr_agent` falls back to choosing
among legal actions at random.

Both are properties of playing a 100bb one-raise strategy against a 200bb
unlimited-raise opponent, and both are reported rather than hidden: the miss rate
comes back with every result, for the same reason the panel reports it.
