"""
The Slumbot HTTP protocol, and nothing else.

This is the first step of `docs/EXTERNAL_BENCHMARK.md`: every strength figure in
this project was computed by this project about itself, and item 1 closed with no
usable bound, so no-limit has no exploitability figure at all. Slumbot is a fixed
CFR strategy at heads-up no-limit behind a free public API, and results against it
are reported in mbb/hand in published work.

Kept deliberately free of any agent. The brief is specific that action translation
is most of the engineering and that a translation bug looks exactly like a weak
strategy, so the layer that talks to the server and the layer that decides what to
say are separate files with separate tests.

The protocol, as measured rather than assumed
----------------------------------------------
``POST /api/new_hand {}`` opens a hand and returns a token. ``POST /api/act
{token, incr}`` sends one action. Both return the same shape; a terminal response
adds ``winnings`` and the bot's cards.

Actions are a compact string: ``b200`` bets *to* 200, ``c`` calls, ``k`` checks,
``f`` folds, and ``/`` separates streets. So ``b200c/kb200`` reads: raise to 200,
call, new street, check, bet to 200.

The stakes, which the translation layer has to bridge
-----------------------------------------------------
Slumbot plays **20,000 chips at 50/100 — 200 big blinds deep**. Measured: folding
as the big blind to an opening raise loses exactly 100. This project's engine and
solver use 200 chips at 1/2, which is **100 big blinds**.

That is not a units conversion, it is a different game. A strategy fitted for 100bb
is off-tree at 200bb from the first decision, and no amount of careful chip
arithmetic fixes it. Whatever plays here has to be built for the depth Slumbot
plays, or the depth has to be reported as a caveat on every number that follows.
