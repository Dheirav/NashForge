"""
The abstract betting tree, and the information-set arithmetic that follows.

Card abstraction bounds how many hands the solver distinguishes; bet abstraction
bounds how many betting lines it distinguishes. Together they decide whether the
game fits in memory, which is the whole feasibility question for running CFR on
a laptop rather than a cluster.

The action space is the project's existing six — fold, check/call, three raise
sizes, all-in — reused as the bet abstraction, with raises capped per street.
That reuse is deliberate but not free: the six actions were designed as a policy
network's output layer, not as a CFR bet abstraction, and **action abstraction
upper-bounds achievable exploitability regardless of how well the solver runs.**
A floor in the exploitability curve may be the action space rather than the
solver, which is why this is stated in the proposal's threats to validity.

Counting information sets exactly needs no engine and no cards: the betting tree
is finite and small, so it is enumerated here, and the total is that count
multiplied by the buckets available on each street.

    A raise schedule: which raise sizes are available at each raise depth.

    An **int** N is the uniform schedule this project has always used, all four
    sizes available for N raises, so ``normalise_schedule(1)`` reproduces the
    shipped abstraction exactly.

    A **tuple** tapers, which is how a deeper betting tree becomes affordable.
    ``(4, 1)`` means four sizes for the opening bet and one for the raise, and
    the one kept is the *largest*, because :data:`RAISE_ACTIONS` runs from
    half-pot up to all-in and the deep options are the ones worth keeping. This
    is the shape Slumbot uses: eleven sizes for an initial bet, eight for a
    raise, three for a three-bet, one thereafter, with no cap on depth. Tapering
    is what buys the depth. Measured on this abstraction at six buckets, a
    second raise costs 7,560,240 information sets if it carries all four sizes
    and 347,136 if it carries only all-in, a 22-fold difference for a tree that
    contains a re-raise either way.

    A level may also be a tuple of action ids, which names the sizes rather
    than counting them: ``((RAISE_HALF, RAISE_POT, ALL_IN), (ALL_IN,))`` is a
    two-level schedule whose opening menu skips the 2x-pot raise. Mixed forms
    are allowed, and the ids are sorted into :data:`RAISE_ACTIONS` order so the
    tree's action indices never depend on how the schedule was written.

    Cached because this sits on the hot path of every traversal.

    An all-in cannot be raised: a player facing one may only fold or call, since
    there are no chips left to raise with. Treating all-in as an ordinary raise
    inflates the tree with lines that cannot occur.

    the solver's action lists and the tree enumeration without further change.
