"""
Card abstraction: collapsing hands into a bounded number of strength buckets.

No-limit Hold'em has on the order of 10^160 information sets; CFR needs
something it can hold in memory. Abstraction is the standard answer — group
hands a solver may treat identically, solve the smaller game, and play the
resulting strategy by mapping real hands into it.

Two streets, two methods:

* **Preflop** has only 169 strategically distinct starting hands, so nothing is
  sampled: all 169 are enumerated and grouped by strength directly. The existing
  Chen-formula score is used, as the project's proposal specifies. With
  ``preflop_buckets`` at :data:`PREFLOP_HANDS` or more the grouping is dropped
  and every starting hand is its own class, which is lossless: six Chen classes
  put KQo, T9s and 77 in one bucket, and on the arena that bucket called a
  three-bet shove 97 percent of the time because it also holds TT and AQ.
  The postflop key carries only the postflop bucket, so the lossless preflop
  costs the tree almost nothing.

* **Postflop** cannot be enumerated — the flop alone has around 26 million
  (hole, board) combinations — so equity is computed on a sample and clustered
  with k-means, following Johanson et al. (2013). New situations are then
  assigned to the nearest centroid.

Bucket 0 is always the weakest. That ordering is not cosmetic: it makes an
abstraction directly comparable across granularities, and it means a strategy
table can be read by a human.

**Abstraction is lossy, and finer is not automatically better.** Waugh et al.
(2009) showed refining an abstraction can make the resulting strategy *more*
exploitable. Granularity is therefore something to measure, which is what
``scripts/cfr/measure_abstraction.py`` does, rather than something to assume.
