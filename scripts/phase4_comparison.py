"""
Phase 4 — three agent families, one panel, one instrument.

The project's title promises a comparison and until today it could not be made:
PPO had trained but never been measured. It can be made now, and mostly by
assembly, because every family already recorded what it needs.

The budget axis is wall-clock, and it was already there
-------------------------------------------------------
The three families laddered along different axes — CFR along training seconds,
evolutionary search along generations, PPO along hands — and a comparison has to
declare one. Wall-clock is the only axis all three share, and none of them needs
re-running to supply it: the CFR budgets are seconds by construction,
`phase2_history.json` records `seconds` per generation, and each PPO history
records `seconds` per interval. So the axis is arithmetic over existing files.

Two hazards, both of which produce a plausible-looking wrong chart
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Units.** `results/cfr/strength_signals.json` is in chips/hand; the endpoint
tests are in BB/100. At big_blind 2 they differ by a factor of fifty, so plotting
them together unconverted shows the CFR agent as fifty times weaker than PPO
rather than stronger — an inversion of the project's central finding, in a chart
that looks fine. Everything is normalised to BB/100 at the boundary here, once.

**Evolution's CFR row exists twice.** `phase2_endpoint.log` reports +60.8 BB/100
against the solver beside a 74.3% lookup miss rate: the benchmark had quietly
become a second random opponent. `phase2_cfr_row.log` is the re-measurement after
that was fixed, at 0.0%, and reads −370.1. This script takes random and
always-call from the first file and the CFR row only from the second, and refuses
to run if the invalid row ever starts looking valid.

What is measured here rather than read
---------------------------------------
The CFR agent's own scores. Its numbers in `strength_signals.json` were taken at
3,000 hands over 2 seeds, against the endpoint tests' 40,000 over 3 — not the
same instrument, and the premise of this phase is one instrument. So it is
re-measured against random and always-call at 40,000 hands with the panel's own
seed. It has no score against itself, and that cell is left empty rather than
filled with a zero that would read as a measurement.
