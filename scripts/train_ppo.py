"""
Phase 3 — PPO with self-play, heads-up, measured against an independent panel.

Two numbers are recorded and they are not the same thing, for exactly the
reason `scripts/train_evolution.py` gives.

**Self-play reward** is the policy against its own frozen past. It is what the
gradient acts on, and it is uninformative as a measure: the matchup is
symmetric and zero-sum, so it sits at zero whatever the policy has learned. A
rising self-play reward would be a defect rather than progress.

**Panel score** is the policy against opponents sharing no ancestry with it —
random, always-call, and the CFR agent, the last validated against Kuhn's
analytic value of -1/18 and exact Leduc exploitability. This is the curve worth
reading, and even then only with its error bar in hand.

The budget is a ladder
----------------------
Checkpoints at 500k, 2M and 8M hands, so Phase 4 gets a budget axis rather than
a single endpoint. They are rungs of one run, not three runs: the 2M policy is
the 500k policy trained further, which is what makes them comparable.

Read the endpoint tests, not the curve here
-------------------------------------------
The panel score recorded at each checkpoint is over 10,000 hands, which is
about **+/-50 BB/100** — measured, not assumed. That is monitoring: it will
show a policy that has collapsed or a benchmark that has degraded, and it will
show nothing else. It is **not** a result, and it is very close to the
resolution at which Phase 2's per-generation curve was read as rising from
+111 to +214 while being indistinguishable from a constant.
`scripts/endpoint_test.py` at 40,000 hands is where the answer comes from.

And the error bar that matters is not that one. Three training seeds of this
same configuration at 200,000 hands scored -68.6, +19.5 and -3.3 against the
CFR agent: a spread of 46 BB/100 between runs that differ only in seed. A
40,000-hand measurement has a +/-14 bar, so quoting that for a multi-seed
result understates the uncertainty threefold. Run the seeds. Report the spread.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/train_ppo.py --seed 0
    python scripts/train_ppo.py --seed 0 --resume        # after an interruption

Three seeds in parallel fit in about 2.1 GB and finish in the time one takes.
Torch is pinned to one thread per run, which is also faster here — 552 hands/s
against 317, the matrices being too small to pay for thread coordination.
