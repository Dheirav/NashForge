"""
Is the 17-feature observation a good one?

Answered by measurement in three parts.

**A. What is in the vector.** Per-feature standard deviation finds dead slots;
the correlation matrix finds duplicates; PCA gives the effective dimensionality.
The August audit found nine components explaining 90% of a seventeen-slot
vector, and one slot with a standard deviation of exactly zero. Nothing has
re-checked it since the observation was made board-aware.

**B. What is missing.** For every sampled state, the player's true equity is
computed by Monte Carlo and compared against what the vector can recover. The
decisive statistic is not the overall R-squared but the *spread of true equity
among states the agent cannot tell apart*: group by near-identical
`hand_strength` and measure the equity range inside each group. A wide range
means the observation is blind in a way no amount of training repairs — a flush
draw and the same overcards without it are the same input.

**C. Whether the proposed fix helps.** Candidate draw and texture features are
computed and B is re-run with them. If the within-group spread collapses, the
case for rebuilding the feature layer is numerical rather than an appeal to the
audit.

Run for both table sizes, because several slots — position, players_behind,
players_in_hand — are close to constant heads-up, and heads-up is the
configuration being trained first.
