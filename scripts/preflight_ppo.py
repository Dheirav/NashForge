"""
Is the PPO training loop sound this time?

`scripts/preflight_training.py` asks this of the evolutionary loop, and the
reason it exists applies here with more force. The PPO stack was carried
through the August audit untested on the grounds that its implementation
looked sound, and when it was finally run rather than read, six of its
measurements were wrong — a reward that never paid the pot, an agent pinned to
one seat, 13% of every rollout spent on hands the agent never played, a fixed
seed that dealt the same hand every time, a critic whose gradient outweighed
the policy's by a factor of 7,000, and a "seeded" run that reproduced nothing.

Every one of those produced a run that completed, logged a falling loss, and
meant nothing. Tests passing is not the same evidence: the tests exercise
components, and what failed was the loop as a whole.

So this runs the real thing, briefly, and checks the properties that were false
— each stated as what it would mean if it failed.

    python scripts/preflight_ppo.py                 # the gate, about 3 minutes
    python scripts/preflight_ppo.py --calibrate     # entropy, about 20 minutes

The machine is shared. Torch is pinned to one thread — which is also *faster*
here, 552 hands/s against 317, because the matrices are small enough that
thread coordination costs more than it saves — and nothing runs in parallel.
