M1 — the first number in this project that somebody else's agent produced.

Step 5 of `docs/EXTERNAL_BENCHMARK.md`. Every strength figure here was computed by
this project about itself, and item 1 closed with no usable bound, so no-limit has
no exploitability figure at all. This does not fix that. It produces one measured
result against a fixed, external, published opponent, which is the whole of what
M1 claims: *10,000 hands with a confidence interval, any result*.

Two estimators, and why the headline is the dull one
-----------------------------------------------------
Slumbot returns `baseline_winnings` beside the actual winnings on every hand. On
the 300-hand pilot the two correlate at 0.85, and differencing them cuts the
spread from 2169 chips to 1362 — a real variance reduction, worth about 1.6x in
hands.

It is not the headline, because **the two estimators disagree in sign**: the pilot
read +130.7 chips/hand raw and −80.5 differenced. What `baseline_winnings` means
is not documented anywhere this project can check, so treating the difference as
the answer is an unverified modelling choice that moves the result across zero.
Item 1's cap-2 row is the precedent — +2.783 one afternoon and −2.900 that
evening, same untouched strategy, only the exploiter's valuation changed.

So the raw win rate is reported as the result, the differenced one is reported
beside it as an alternative whose interpretation is unverified, and neither is
quietly preferred to the other.

What is being measured, stated plainly
---------------------------------------
A 100bb, one-raise-per-street solver playing a 200bb unlimited-raise opponent. It
is not this project's strength at Slumbot's game and must not be quoted as though
it were. The lookup miss rate comes back with the result for the same reason the
panel reports it.
