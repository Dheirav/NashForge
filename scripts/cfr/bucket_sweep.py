How many card buckets should the solver use, given N seconds?

Six buckets is what every figure in this project was produced with, and it was
never chosen. Heads-up no-limit has 169 distinct starting hands before a board
is dealt, and this abstraction sorts all of them, plus every flop, turn and
river, into six classes. `abstraction/betting.py` states the consequence
directly: **action and card abstraction upper-bound achievable exploitability
regardless of how well the solver runs.** After the 200bb retrain, training and
stack depth are both spent as levers against Slumbot, which leaves the
abstraction as the binding constraint and this as the cheaper of its two
dimensions.

Cheap in memory, that is. From `results/cfr/abstraction_size.json` at raise cap 1:

    6 buckets      49,200 information sets     4.7 MB
    20 buckets    164,000 information sets    15.7 MB
    50 buckets    410,000 information sets    39.4 MB

Nothing there is a constraint on this machine. The cost is elsewhere: the same
traversals now have to cover eight times as many decisions, so a finer
abstraction is a better map that the solver has less time to read.

Why the budget axis is wall-clock
---------------------------------
A finer abstraction covers a smaller share of a larger tree per iteration, and
may also cost more per iteration to read. Wall-clock charges both together, and
"given N seconds, how many buckets" is the question a practitioner actually
faces. Budgeting by iterations would waive whichever part of the cost is
per-iteration and hand the finer arm more CPU for the same nominal budget.

**Do not assume the per-iteration part is even positive.** A single measurement
on 10 September, 3,000 iterations at `equity_samples=40`, read 32.4 ms/it at 6
buckets and 26.0 ms/it at 50, which is the wrong way round and was taken on a
shared machine without replication. That is why every rung records
`{left,right}_ms_per_iteration` per arm across every seed: the sweep answers this
as a side effect rather than leaving it as an assumption in a docstring.

**This makes the axis sensitive to the machine, which is a real hazard here.**
This project already withdrew a wall-clock axis once: an identical 8M-hand run
read 4.81 h on a quiet machine and 10.42 h sharing cores with another job. Every
rung records the load average sampled *during* its own window, per arm, and
flags an imbalance above 1.0. A sweep run under heavy or varying contention is
measuring the machine and its rows should not be pooled with a quiet one's.

It is the axis `crossover.py` and `head_to_head.py` already use, which keeps this
result comparable to the abstraction crossover rather than making it a separate
thing.

Why head to head rather than exploitability
-------------------------------------------
Local Best Response is confined to the same abstraction as the strategy it
measures, so it evaluates each arm on its own terms and goes slack. That
investigation was closed with no usable bound. Playing the arms against each
other sidesteps it, at the cost of the weaker claim: whoever wins has answered
"which should I use", not "how good is it".

**Each arm is asked the question its own bucketing poses.** Two bucket counts
produce different information-set keys, so handing one arm the other's key would
make it look like a bad player rather than a mismatched lookup. `strategy_policy`
takes an abstraction for exactly this reason. Nothing about the *game* is
abstracted: cards are dealt for real and showdowns settled on real hands, so
every arm plays the same poker and only its view of it differs.

What to expect, written down before the run
-------------------------------------------
If bucket count behaves the way the strength signal did, the fine arms lose at
the short budgets and cross above the coarse ones later. **If 6 buckets wins at
every budget, that is a real finding**: it would mean the card abstraction is not
the constraint, and the next effort belongs at the raise cap instead.
