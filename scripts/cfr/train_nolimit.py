Milestone 5 — train a CFR agent on abstracted heads-up no-limit Hold'em.

Fits a card abstraction, runs external-sampling MCCFR over the abstracted game,
and measures the resulting strategy against baselines by playing hands.

Two honest limits on what this can report, both stated rather than papered over:

* **Exploitability is not computable here.** Kuhn and Leduc allow an exact best
  response; no-limit does not. Local Best Response gives a lower bound and is
  the next piece of work. Until then the only measure available is head-to-head
  chips, which is a weaker claim: beating a passive baseline shows the strategy
  is not broken, not that it is near equilibrium.

* **Head-to-head results need error bars.** Poker results over a few thousand
  hands are dominated by variance. Every figure below carries a standard error
  and a 95% interval, and seats alternate so position is not a confound.
