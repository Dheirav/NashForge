"""
What our short rungs' small raises cost against exact push-fold play.

    venv/bin/python scripts/push_fold_cost.py --rungs 5bb 8bb 12bb --hands 40000

Below about twelve big blinds the game is fold-or-shove, and it is small
enough to solve exactly (`push_fold.py`): at eight blinds the button shoves
62% of hands and the big blind calls 45%. Our 8bb rung instead raises to about
a third of its stack on 47% of hands and shoves on 6%. A first attempt to
price that (22 September, `push_fold_arena.py`) charged every non-shove as a
fold and read 0.44 big blinds a decision for every bot alike, which is the
signature of a measurement measuring itself: a half-pot raise at eight blinds
is not a fold.

This prices it properly, by playing it. Our rung sits in the small blind
against an opponent that plays the exact solution: it shoves its solved range,
and facing a raise of any size it calls with the hands whose equity beats the
price and folds the rest, which is the best response to being raised small.
Both sides see real cards, the hand is run out when the chips go in, and the
result is chips per hand from our seat. Zero would mean the small raises cost
nothing; a large negative number means the short rungs should be given
shove-or-fold and nothing else, which is the game they are in.
