"""
Leg (d) of the stopping rule: where a hand faces an all-in preflop, what do the
solve's calls and folds cost, and does a stronger hand fold more than the hand
one rank below it?

    venv/bin/python scripts/fold_jumps.py results/cfr/ladder169l_v5f/cap2_70bb.pkl
    venv/bin/python scripts/fold_jumps.py rung_10m.pkl rung_20m.pkl      # T, then 2T: the verdict
    venv/bin/python scripts/fold_jumps.py results/cfr/ladder169l_v5xRR3   # every rung of a ladder

The stopping rule's other legs average over play. The gate and the head to
head score tens of thousands of hands and LBR scores a best response, so none
of them sees one hand class that is wrong at one node. On 22 September such a
node lost a fixture (v5f's 70bb rung put 27% of nine-ten suited on an all-in),
and lane IT's 60M polish deleted another, v5f's 98% pocket-jacks shove. Both
were our own shoves, which `scripts/strategy_sweep.py` lists. This is the
other side of the same spot: what we call an all-in with.

A jump in itself is not a defect. At an all-in the right answer is close to a
threshold, call above it and fold below, so two adjacent hands can sit a whole
1.0 apart and both be right. What cannot be right is the order going the wrong
way: a hand that beats its neighbour card for card (AQs against AJs, KK against
QQ, KJo against QJo) folding clearly more often. So the check compares each
class with the class one rank below it in either card, same suitedness, and
flags the pairs where the stronger one folds at least `--threshold` more.

Two things would fill the list with noise and are left out:

* **Classes that do not reach the node.** A class that never makes the raise
  before the all-in has an average strategy there that nothing ever trained,
  and it never plays. Each class's own reach (the product of its own action
  probabilities along the history) must be at least `--min-reach`.
* **Entries still exactly uniform.** These were never visited at all; they are
  counted and reported, not compared.

Own reach is not enough by itself. At `5` (the small blind open-shoves) the big
blind has not acted, so every class has an own reach of 1, and yet the node is
almost never trained, because the solver's small blind almost never shoves
there. On the 70bb (4,2,1) rung at 20M that node and the three where the small
blind's raise is re-raised all-in by a line it rarely meets held 59 of the 70
flagged pairs, at a line probability of 0.002 or less. So each flag is weighted
by how often the line is played: the opponent's line probability (its range's
own reach, by combinations) times the stronger class's own reach.

With two solves of the same tree, at T and 2T, the leg passes when that
weighted excess is no larger at 2T than at T: more iterations must not make the
order worse where the order is played. The raw count is printed beside it.

**The verdict is on chips, not on the order (6 October).** The rank check was
the first version, and pricing its flags showed why it cannot be the verdict.
At 12bb, after a limp and a shove, Q7s folding 97% against Q6s calling 63% was
the most flagged pair on the rung, and it was Q7s that was right: both hands sit
under the 45.8% a call needs, so the stronger one folding is correct and the
weaker one calling is the (tiny) mistake. Near the calling line the rank order
is not even the equity order, because a shove range full of AJ, KJ and QJ
dominates a jack more than a ten (T8s has more equity than J8s there). So the
check now prices each node:

* **The price** comes from the trainer's own chip rules. The history is replayed
  through `games.nolimit.NoLimitHoldem` (the native solver sizes raises by the
  same formula), which gives what the player to act must call and the final pot
  if it does, with an all-in larger than our stack returning its excess.
* **The equity** of each class against the opponent's range at the node, where
  the range is each class's combinations times the opponent's own reach to the
  node, from the 169 by 169 preflop all-in table
  (`results/cfr/chance/nolimit_12bb_preflop_allin.npy`, P(win) - P(lose) over
  sampled runouts, so each cell carries a few hundredths of noise). Preflop
  all-in equity does not depend on the stacks, so the 12bb table holds at every
  depth. Card removal between the two hands is ignored.
* **The cost** of a class is what its fold share loses against the best reply
  to that range: the call's value times the fold share when calling wins, the
  call's loss times the call share when it loses. It is weighted by how often
  the class is dealt and reaches the node and by the opponent's line
  probability, and summed in big blinds per 100 hands dealt at that depth.

This is the solve measured against the best reply to its own ranges at each
all-in, not exploitability: a range that is itself wrong is not caught here.
The T against 2T verdict passes when the total cost is no larger at 2T. The rank
pairs are still printed, as a list to read, not a verdict.

Limits. Raising one card by a rank is nearly always worth equity against an
all-in range, but not always by much: connectors against one-gappers (87s and
97s) are close, so a rank flag there may be noise around a real tie. Entries
still uniform are priced as they would play (half fold, half call), since the
bot would play them that way. Preflop only, because only there are the classes
hands; a postflop bucket mixes strength with texture.
