"""
The push-fold game at short stacks, solved exactly, and what each bot loses to it.

    venv/bin/python scripts/push_fold.py --measure hoops Blueprint --depths 6 8 10 12 15

Below about fifteen big blinds a heads-up hand is nearly always decided before
the flop: the small blind shoves or folds, and the big blind calls or folds.
That game is small enough to solve exactly rather than approximately, which is
the opposite of every other depth in this project, and its solution is a pair
of lists: which of the 169 starting hands to shove, and which to call with.
Both follow from one 169-by-169 matrix of all-in equities
(`scripts/cfr/preflop_allin.py`) by iterating best responses until they stop
moving, which they do in a handful of rounds because each side's list is
monotone in strength.

The measurement this exists for: every set we trained this week gained six to
fifteen big blinds per hundred at deep stacks and nothing below 25, because
there is little room between good and perfect once the game is fold-or-shove.
The room is in the opponent's errors, and here they are exactly priceable: for
a bot's observed shoving and calling lists, the chips it gives away per hand
against correct play, in big blinds. That number says whether a short-stack
exploiter is worth training at all.
