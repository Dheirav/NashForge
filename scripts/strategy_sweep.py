Read a solve's strategy for implausible actions, before it plays.

    venv/bin/python scripts/strategy_sweep.py results/cfr/experiments/cap2_70bb_t421_20m_warm.pkl --threshold 0.2

The cross-tree gate and the replay judge a set by what it scores over tens of
thousands of hands. Neither can see one node that is wrong a quarter of the
time in a spot that arises once a match. On 22 September such a node lost a
season 7 fixture: v5f's 70bb rung held 27% of nine-ten suited on an all-in
facing a two-blind open, and put 77 big blinds in. Three sets sharing the same
tree held 0 to 1% there, so it was that solve's convergence, not the design,
and a minute of reading the table would have shown it.

Two checks, both cheap and both over the whole table rather than a sample:

* **Heavy shoves.** Nodes where a sized raise is legal and the all-in still
  carries at least `--threshold` of the weighted mass. Preflop nodes are
  listed separately because that is where a shove is most often wrong and
  most expensive.
* **Uniform entries.** Nodes whose strategy is within a hair of uniform, which
  means the solve never really visited them; the fallback would have been as
  good, and a lot of them at shallow histories says the rung is undertrained.

Nothing here is automatically a defect. Shoving the river after three bets is
ordinary. The list is what to read before a set plays.
