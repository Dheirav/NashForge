"""
A viewer that plays the hand the benchmark scores.

The previous controller reimplemented the betting loop: its own raise sizing,
its own action-name matching, no solver history string, no raise cap, and no
`finish_hand()`. So the game on screen was not the game `benchmark()` measures,
and the pot was never awarded — `is_hand_over()` means the betting finished,
not that the chips moved, which is the exact trap `_play_hand` documents. It
also loaded a genome from `hall_of_fame/`, which is empty and whose former
contents the audit withdrew.

This drives `evaluation.benchmark`'s own primitives instead — the same mask,
the same constraint onto the solver's tree, the same action conversion, the
same settle. The human occupies one seat; anything with the panel's agent
signature occupies the other.

Stacks reset to the benchmark's depth every hand
------------------------------------------------
Not an oversight, and not the same thing as forgetting the score. The solver
was fitted for one stack depth, and letting stacks drift across hands walks it
out of the tree it knows while the display goes on calling it the CFR agent.
`benchmark()` deals every hand from the same depth for that reason, so this
does too, and keeps the running total separately.
