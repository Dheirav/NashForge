"""
The interface a game must expose to be solved by regret minimization.

CFR does not *play* a game, it **traverses** one: at every decision it recurses
into all of the acting player's actions, and at every deal it recurses into all
outcomes weighted by probability. A simulator cannot support that. The existing
``engine.PokerGame`` mutates state in place, consumes a dealt deck, and has no
notion of "what this player knows" — so a traverser cannot branch over actions,
back up, and try the other one.

This module defines what tree search needs instead. Kuhn poker, Leduc Hold'em
and eventually an adapter over the no-limit engine all implement it, so the
solver, the best-response calculator and the exploitability metric are written
once against this and never against a specific game.

Two rules matter more than the rest:

* ``next_state`` must return a NEW state and never mutate its argument. A
  traverser holds a parent state while exploring each child; mutating in place
  corrupts the traversal in ways that surface as subtly wrong strategies rather
  than as crashes.

* ``information_set`` must contain exactly what the acting player knows — their
  own private cards and the public history — and nothing else. Leaking an
  opponent's card into that key lets the solver condition on hidden information.
  It will converge happily to a strategy that cheats, and the exploitability
  number will look excellent, because the best response is computed against the
  same leaky abstraction.
