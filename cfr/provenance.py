"""
Where a solve came from, written beside it when it is trained.

The 170 solves behind our old ladders (7 Oct) each keep their full training
arguments, but none says which code trained it, while the native solver, the
abstraction and the trainer changed 25 times from 15 September; 92 of them were
built on another solve (its buckets or a warm start) that is no more permanent
than they are; and most ran on 2 to 6 threads, so the same code and seed do not
give the same file. A solve that cannot be rebuilt cannot be safely deleted, and
a disk that filled on 7 Oct made that a real question. So every training run now
records, at its start, the commit it ran on (and whether the tree was dirty), the
command, the machine, and a digest of every solve it was built on; and
`scripts/solve_manifest.py` keeps one entry per solve with its files' digests,
its sources and the ladders that use it.
