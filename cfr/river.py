"""
River endgame solving on the exact hand.

The blueprint plays the river through six equity buckets and a betting tree
fitted before the cards were known. Here, once the river is dealt, the river is
solved afresh: over the 1,081 exact hole-card pairs the board allows, with each
player's range taken from the blueprint's own reach along the public history
(unsafe re-solving, the choice every practical bot since 2017 has made), with
the pot, the outstanding bet and the stacks as they actually are, and with the
opponent's actual bet size at the root rather than a translated one.

Ganzfried and Sandholm (AAMAS 2015) measured +29 to +87 mbb/hand on river hands
from a base that already had thousands of buckets; ours has six, so the
headroom is larger. It also removes the river's off-tree misses, because the
tree is built at decision time from the live chips.

The solver is vector-form CFR+ with linear averaging: regrets and strategy sums
are arrays over hands, terminal utilities come from one sort of the hands by
rank with per-card prefix sums for the blocker correction, and all showdown
terminals are evaluated in one batch. About 160 nodes and 80 terminals on a
two-raise river; a few milliseconds an iteration in numpy.

Behind a flag everywhere it is reachable (`ArenaPlayer(river=...)`,
`chipzen_run.py --river-solve`). Nothing measured in this project has gone
through it yet.
