Strategy purification: play a cleaner version of a solved strategy.

An abstracted, sampled solve leaves small probabilities on actions it has not finished ruling out, and at
play time those are noise. Ganzfried and Sandholm (2012) found removing them often helps against strong
opponents: *purification* plays the most probable action, *thresholding* drops actions below a share and
keeps the rest mixed. Both raise worst-case exploitability, so each mode is judged by head to head, the
field duels and LBR together. One function, so the agent that plays and LBR that measures see the same thing.

Modes: "none"; "postflop" and "all" (the most probable action, after the flop or everywhere, first on a tie);
"t10", "t20", ... (drop actions under that percentage of the node's mass, renormalise, keep sampling).
