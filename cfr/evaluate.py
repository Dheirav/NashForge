"""
Measuring a strategy: expected value, best response, and exploitability.

A solver that converges to the right *value* has not necessarily found an
equilibrium — many non-equilibrium strategies share the same value against a
particular opponent. The measure that actually pins it down is **exploitability**:
how much a best-responding opponent wins. At a Nash equilibrium of a two-player
zero-sum game it is zero, and it decreases monotonically as CFR converges.

Computing a best response in an imperfect-information game is not "take the
argmax at each node". A player cannot see which state within an information set
they are in, so one action must be chosen for the whole set, and its value is
the sum over the set's states weighted by how likely the *opponent and chance*
were to produce each of them. Choosing per state instead computes the value of a
cheater and reports exploitability far too high.

The implementation below groups states by information set and decides deepest
sets first, so that when a set is decided every choice beneath it is already
fixed. This relies on perfect recall, which Kuhn and Leduc both have.
