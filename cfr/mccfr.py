"""
External-sampling Monte Carlo CFR (Lanctot et al., 2009).

Vanilla CFR walks the entire tree every iteration, which is exact and becomes
impossible the moment a game is interesting. External sampling keeps the
traverser's own decisions exhaustive but samples everything external to them —
chance, and the opponent's actions. Per-iteration cost becomes proportional to a
sampled path rather than to the whole tree, and the regret estimates stay
unbiased, so convergence guarantees survive.

Two details that are easy to get subtly wrong, and that produce a solver which
converges to something plausible rather than failing loudly:

* **Only the traverser's actions are enumerated.** Sampling the traverser's
  action too gives outcome sampling, a different (higher-variance) estimator
  with a different correction term. Mixing the two silently biases the regrets.

* **The average strategy is accumulated at the opponent's nodes**, where the
  reach probability the estimator needs is exactly the sampling probability that
  brought the walk there. Accumulating it at the traverser's nodes instead —
  which reads naturally, since that is where the strategy is being improved —
  weights the average by the wrong distribution.

One "iteration" runs the traversal once per player, so both players' regrets
advance together.
