"""
Local Best Response — a computable lower bound on exploitability.

Exploitability is the measure that matters: how much a best-responding opponent
wins. On Kuhn and Leduc it is computed exactly by traversing the tree. No-limit
Hold'em cannot be traversed, so the only alternative has been head-to-head chip
counts — and beating a passive baseline says nothing about distance from
equilibrium.

LBR (Lisý & Bowling, 2017) closes that gap. Instead of a true best response it
plays a *greedy* one: track what the opponent's actions reveal about their hand,
then at each decision pick whichever action looks best under a one-step
lookahead. Because that is only a subset of the strategies a real best response
could play, whatever LBR wins is a **lower bound** on exploitability. A large
LBR value proves a strategy is exploitable; a small one proves nothing, which is
the direction of the guarantee and worth stating whenever the number is quoted.

Two design choices specific to this implementation:

* **The opponent's range is a weighted set of candidate hands**, resampled once
  per hand and reweighted by Bayes as the opponent acts. The obvious cheaper
  alternative — carrying a distribution over bucket indices — does not work
  here, because :class:`~abstraction.buckets.CardAbstraction` fits a *separate*
  clustering per street. Bucket 3 on the flop and bucket 3 on the turn are
  unrelated categories, so a belief accumulated over one street's indices cannot
  be carried into the next. Tracking hands and re-bucketing them against
  whatever board is actually out keeps every lookup on the street it belongs to.

* **After the modelled action the hand is rolled out to showdown**, with no
  further betting. This is the standard LBR simplification and it is why the
  result is a bound rather than the true value: LBR never plans a second barrel.

LBR sees only what a real opponent would: its own cards, the board, and the
betting. It never reads ``state.hole`` for the player it is exploiting.
