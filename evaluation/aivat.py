"""
AIVAT's practical subset for the arena logs (Burch, Schmid, Moravcik and Bowling, AAAI 2018).

A hand's realised net is replaced by

    net - sum over chance nodes and our decisions of (v(what happened) - E[v over what could have happened])

where v is a value function frozen before the data it scores is seen. Each subtracted term has expectation zero
given everything before it, so the mean is unchanged whatever v is, while a v that tracks the hand's eventual result
cancels the luck of the deal and the board. Three kinds of term are used:

- **the deal of our hole cards**: E over all 1,326 holdings, which is exact because nothing else is known yet;
- **each board card or flop**: E over the cards we have not seen. The opponent's two cards are among them, so this is
  not quite the true conditional distribution (that would need the opponent's range); the error is a card-removal
  effect of order 2/47 of the term, and the simulation in `scripts/aivat_sim.py` bounds what it does to the mean;
- **our own decisions**, only where the distribution we sampled from is known exactly: a decision row that carries
  it (`probs`). A purified set plays one action with certainty, so its term is identically zero and is left out,
  and a zero term is unbiased by construction. An approximate distribution is never used, because a wrong one is
  exactly what makes the term's mean nonzero.

The opponent's decisions get no term, as AIVAT allows for a player whose strategy is unknown, and neither does the
deal of their cards, which we see only at showdown and on our folds: a term that exists only when the opponent's
cards happen to be shown would be selected on what came after it. A called all-in before the river keeps the exact
treatment of `--allin-adjust` (its base value is the expectation over the runouts, which is AIVAT with a perfect
value function on those chance nodes), and only the chance nodes up to the all-in street get a heuristic term.

The value function is v = g_street(pot, effective stack) * (equity against a random hand - 1/2) for a state where
the contributions are equal, and minus our contribution after a fold. Equity is exact (every opponent holding and
every runout) after the flop and a frozen table preflop. Because equity against a random hand from the unseen cards
is a martingale over the next card, E over the next card of v is v with the previous street's equity, so no chance
expectation has to be enumerated: a chance term is g * (equity now - equity before). With g = pot, v is the
check-down value against a random hand (pot * equity less our half of it); the frozen file fits g's two coefficients per street on matches played
before the bursts it is used on (`scripts/aivat_fit.py`).
