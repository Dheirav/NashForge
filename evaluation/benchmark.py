"""
One panel every agent is measured against, whatever produced it.

The failure this exists to prevent is the one the audit found: agents evaluated
against other agents from the same lineage, so a population could improve
against itself for 89 runs while getting worse at poker, and nothing in the
numbers said so. A benchmark is only worth having if it does not share the
lineage of what it measures.

The panel is `random`, `always-call`, and **the CFR agent** — the last of which
was validated against Kuhn poker's analytic value of −1/18 and exact
exploitability on Leduc, and shares no ancestry with an evolutionary or
policy-gradient run.

Both games, one match
---------------------
The solver lives in :mod:`games.nolimit`, a traversable reimplementation; the
networks train against :class:`engine.PokerGame`. Matches are played in the
*engine*, so no agent is evaluated somewhere other than where it was trained —
a train/evaluate split is precisely how the previous feature bugs hid.

That works because both sides already share the same six abstract actions
(fold, check/call, half pot, pot, two pot, all-in). Since this harness drives
the loop, it knows which abstract action each agent chose and maintains the
solver's ``bucket|history`` key itself, so the CFR agent's lookup is exact
rather than translated. Two constraints are applied to make the engine's legal
set agree with the tree the solver was trained on:

* **A raise cap**, matching the solver's. The engine mask permits unlimited
  raises per street; the solver has never seen those histories.
* **No folding with nothing to call.** The engine offers it, the solver's tree
  excludes it as dominated. An agent that takes it is throwing away a free
  card, so removing it costs nothing and keeps the histories aligned.

Where the lookup misses anyway — an unreached information set — the CFR agent
plays uniformly over legal actions, and :attr:`BenchmarkResult.lookup_miss_rate`
reports how often. A benchmark quietly degrading to a random opponent is worse
than no benchmark, so the rate is measured rather than assumed small.

Duplicate play
--------------
Each hand is dealt twice from the same seed with the seats swapped, so both
agents hold the same cards against the same opposing cards and card luck
cancels rather than being averaged over. The engine reseeds per hand, so this
is exact rather than best-effort.

    A solved strategy, playing in the engine.

    ``purify`` plays the most probable action rather than sampling. Its stated
    purpose in the ACPC record (Ganzfried and Sandholm 2012; Tartanian7, 2015:
    +17 to +25 mbb/h against Slumbot-class bots) is to compensate for an
    unconverged average strategy, which is where this project's blueprints are.
    Off by default, because it is a change to the instrument every panel figure
    was measured with, and it raises worst-case exploitability against an
    opponent who adapts.

    The key is rebuilt here rather than read off the engine: the bucket comes
    from the cards, which are the same objects in both games, and the history is
    the one this harness has been maintaining.

    The stored probabilities are then spread onto the six abstract actions
    through the solver's own legal-action list for that node. Treating the array
    as already six-wide was wrong twice over — it discarded 77.5% of successful
    lookups as "missing", and had the lengths happened to match it would have
    read the numbers against the wrong actions silently.

    ``misses`` is a two-slot counter, [missed, consulted], so a benchmark that
    has quietly become a second random opponent shows up as a number.

    ``on_miss`` is what a lookup miss plays: ``random`` (the panel's uniform
    draw over legal actions, the default every panel figure was measured with)
    or ``call``, check/call where legal else fold. The second exists for the
    cross-tree gate: a cap-2 solve against a one-raise one misses on lines the
    bigger tree never visited, and a random shove there measured the fallback
    rather than the solve (25bb read −29.6 random, −17.5 call, 17 September).

    ``stack_cap`` mirrors the trees' rule that a player who cannot cover the
    bet has only fold and call: both solvers store a two-wide entry there,
    and without the mirror this harness reconstructed the full list, rejected
    the entry as the wrong width, and played the miss policy at exactly the
    "facing a big bet" nodes. 34% of a cap-2 rung's keys are such nodes (19
    September); a one-raise tree's two-wide nodes happen to match anyway,
    which is why only cap-2 solves suffered. Off by default because the arena
    player's chip scale is the bridge's, not this engine's; on in the gates.

    ``probe`` is the same idea for the viewer: it receives the distribution
    actually sampled from, or ``None`` where no entry existed and the choice
    was a guess. The GUI shows the policy, and re-deriving it alongside the
    agent is how the shown numbers and the played ones drift apart.
