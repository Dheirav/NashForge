"""
The shared benchmark panel.

This harness decides what every trained agent's number means, so its own bugs
are worth more than the agents'. The one found while writing it is the type
specimen: `is_hand_over()` means the betting finished, not that the pot was
paid, so reading stacks at that point scored every hand as a loss of whatever
had been contributed. It looked completely stable — every deal returned exactly
−2 — and was completely wrong. Stability is not correctness, so the first test
here checks the chips, not the plausibility of the result.
