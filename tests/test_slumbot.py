"""
The Slumbot betting string, parsed.

No network. These cover the reading of Slumbot's action notation, which is where
the first class of translation bug lives: a misread betting string produces a
legal-looking action at the wrong price, and the result is a losing number that
looks like a weak strategy rather than a bug. `docs/EXTERNAL_BENCHMARK.md` is
explicit that the two are indistinguishable from the result alone, which is why
this is tested away from the server.

The notation, confirmed against the live API: ``b200`` bets *to* 200, ``c``
calls, ``k`` checks, ``f`` folds, ``/`` separates streets.
