"""
Milestone 3: external-sampling MCCFR and the regret update rules.

Two things are checked here, and they are deliberately different in kind.

**Correctness** is asserted: every update rule, under sampling, must still reach
Kuhn's known value of -1/18 and must still reduce exploitability on Leduc. A
sampler that is subtly biased — enumerating the wrong player's actions, or
accumulating the average strategy at the wrong nodes — converges to something
plausible rather than failing loudly, so the analytic answer is the check.

**Which rule is fastest is not asserted.** That is the experiment
``scripts/cfr/compare_update_rules.py`` exists to answer, across several seeds.
Encoding its expected outcome as a test would be assuming the result and then
reporting the assumption as evidence.
