"""
The viewer's loop, checked against the loop it is supposed to be.

Two things were wrong before, and neither would have shown up as an exception.
The pot was never awarded, because the old controller dealt again on
`is_hand_over()` — which means the betting stopped, not that the chips moved —
so a session's chip counts were quietly meaningless. And no solver history
string was kept, so the CFR agent missed every lookup and played as a second
random opponent under its own name.

Both are silent, so both are asserted here rather than left to be noticed.
