"""
Review tests for `bridge_translation` (branch lbr-overbet), written to cover what
tests/test_lbr_overbet.py leaves out: postflop and re-raise readings checked
against `chipzen.bridge.replay` on a grid of sizes around the 1.5x line, every
rung schedule the ladders use (one of which puts the line at 1.5 pot, not 3.0),
chip rounding, stack caps, the all-in-only depth, the re-read lookup taken (and
missed) in a played hand, the counters with both options on, and off-arm pins
computed from HEAD's cfr/lbr.py.
