Milestone 1: prove the solver correct on a game whose answer is known.

Kuhn poker has an analytic solution — the game value to the first player is
exactly -1/18, and the equilibria form a one-parameter family. Establishing that
CFR reproduces both, before any abstraction or sampling exists to confound the
result, is the point of building Kuhn at all. A solver that fails here cannot be
diagnosed later once approximation error is also present.

The best-response calculator is itself cross-checked against exhaustive
enumeration of every pure strategy, so the exploitability figures rest on
something obviously correct rather than on a clever implementation.
