"""
Chipzen's hand, expressed as something this project's solver can answer.

The arena sends a structured `turn_request`: hole cards and board as strings,
the pot, both stacks, what it costs to call, the legal raise range, and every
action so far as `{seat, action, amount, phase}` with `amount` the **total bet
level on that street** after the action. That is the same "bet to a level"
notation Slumbot uses, so this module is `slumbot/bridge.py` with the string
parser replaced by a walk over a list, and it reuses that module's `Node` and
card parsing rather than growing a second copy of either.

Two things are done differently from the Slumbot bridge, both on purpose.

**Raise fractions are measured the way the engine defines them.** The solver's
raise sizes are fractions of the pot *after the call*; the Slumbot bridge
measured an incoming raise against the pot before it, which agrees for an
opening bet and disagrees for a re-raise. Under a one-raise tree a re-raise was
off-tree anyway, so it never mattered. Under a taper it does.

**Translation respects the raise schedule.** A re-raise under `(4, 2)` may only
be two times pot or all-in, so an incoming re-raise is translated onto those two
and not onto all three sizes. Translating onto a size the solver never had at
that depth produces a key the solver never stored, and the miss would then be
counted as a depth problem when it was a bridge bug.

Stacks and blinds are whatever the arena says they are. Matches start at 10,000
chips with blinds 50 and 100, the blinds rise on a schedule, and the stacks carry
over from hand to hand until one bot has everything. Nothing here assumes a
depth; the player picks the solver from the effective stack in big blinds.
