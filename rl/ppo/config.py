@dataclass
class PPOConfig:
    """
    Full configuration for a PPO training run.

    Network
    -------
    obs_size:        Feature vector length (must match engine.get_state_vector).
    num_actions:     Number of abstract actions (must match engine action space).
    hidden_size:     Width of each hidden layer in the actor-critic trunk.
    num_layers:      Number of shared trunk layers.

    Environment
    -----------
    num_players:     Table size.  2 = heads-up, 6 = 6-max.
    starting_stack:  Starting chip count per player.
    small_blind:     Small blind.
    big_blind:       Big blind.
    use_aggression_shaper: Add AggressionShaper dense reward.

    Rollout
    -------
    n_steps:         Agent *decisions* to collect per update, not hands. A
                     heads-up hand is about 1.8 decisions.
    n_envs:          Number of parallel environments (threads).

    PPO update
    ----------
    n_epochs:        Gradient epochs per rollout.
    batch_size:      Mini-batch size for gradient update.
    gamma:           Discount factor (set close to 1 for sparse terminal reward).
    gae_lambda:      GAE λ for advantage estimation.
    clip_range:      PPO clip ε.
    vf_coef:         Value function loss coefficient.
    ent_coef:        Entropy bonus coefficient.
    max_grad_norm:   Gradient clipping.
    lr:              Adam learning rate.
    lr_decay:        Multiply lr by this factor each update cycle (1.0 = no decay).
    target_kl:       Early-stop update if approx KL exceeds this (None = disabled).

    Training schedule
    -----------------
    total_hands:     Total environment steps (hands); controls run length.
    eval_every:      Evaluate vs opponent pool every N update cycles.
    save_every:      Save checkpoint every N update cycles.
    checkpoint_dir:  Directory to save checkpoints.
    log_dir:         Directory for training logs (CSV).

    Self-play opponents
    -------------------
    snapshot_every:      Update cycles between policy snapshots into the pool.
    snapshot_pool_size:  How many past snapshots to retain (the most recent N).
    current_policy_prob: Probability of facing the live policy rather than a
                         snapshot. Below 1.0 the policy spends most hands
                         against its own past, which is the point.

    The hall-of-fame options that used to live here are gone. The directory is
    empty, and every genome that would have filled it was bred on the fitness
    function the audit withdrew — see rl/ppo/snapshots.py.
