# The cross-tree gate: a cap-2 solve against the one-raise rung at the same
# depth, in the real game, check/call on a miss. This is the instrument for
# solver work since 17 September: a converged cap-2 solve cannot lose to the
# one-raise strategy, which is a legal strategy inside its game, so the number
# is how unconverged the solve is, in BB/100. The same-tree gate is nearly blind
# to the same change (+2.9 between solves 13 points apart on this one).
